## Springer ~~Open~~ Books in Statistics

I saw this: https://gist.github.com/bishboria/8326b17bbd652f34566a and was kind of bored so I decided I had to do the scrapping excersise the R way to put up the statistics books full list with direct links in a single place.

You can see the current list of open stat books [at Springer](http://link.springer.com/search/page/1?facet-content-type="Book"&showAll=false&facet-language="En"&facet-discipline="Statistics") or re-run the script yourself. 

At the time I ran the scripts these were the books that appeared as open:

- [All statistics books](all_stat_books.md)
- [Books from the _Springer Texts in Statistics_ series](texts_in_statistics.md)
- [Books from the _Lecture Notes in Statistics_ series](lecture_notes_in_statistics.md)

(They are ordered chronollogically which is how they appear in Springer).

The next day "Springer had pulled the free plug" on most books so I thought it wasn't worth uploding the repo. I decided to upload it anyways for my own reference (I guess it's still a nice scrapping excersise).

The `.r` script produces the three `.md` files and is rather generic so it can be easily modified to make (or download, see the final comment in the script) other book lists on Springer - including non-open books (which can't be downloaded but should have working links to the official page).
